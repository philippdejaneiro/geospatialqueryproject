GEOSPATIAL-QUERY-PROJECT

On startup, the app fetches the latest observation file. This is indicated by 
the message "obtaining data..." in the 2nd line. Once this is done, the message
changes to "Data obtained from NDBC server: ...".

In order to query the latest observations near a specified location, type in 
longitude, latitude and query radius and hit the button "Query Observations in 
Radius".

Alternatively to typing in the parameters, you can hit one of the buttons "Set 
to my Geolocation" (which might show no results if you live far from the ocean
and the specified radius is too small) or "Set to dummy location" which should 
give you some results.
